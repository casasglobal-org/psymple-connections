# psymple-connections
A global connections interface for psymple

## Note
This is not a yet a functional repo. Significant refactoring is required, including separating out code, setting up classes for multiple inheritance with `psymple` base classes, and addressing known bugs noted in the code. Documentation and automated testing is also required.

The creation of this repo at this stage serves to make this code public, and allow issues to be raised and documented.
